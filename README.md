# NLP

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The content is curated from a variety of sources including online courses from platforms like Coursera, edX, and other educational resources and/or blogs.

The aim is to establish a comprehensive knowledge base for myself and, eventually, for others who share a passion for NLP. My journey will involve periodic learning and documentation of concepts in NLP, from foundational theories to advanced applications.
